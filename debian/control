Description: pipe buffer utility (static binary)
 blobomnom buffers up to 1 GiB at a time of standard input
 and drains it into standard output. The key feature is the
 1 GiB buffer.
 .
 The main use case it was designed for was `curl .../x.tar.xz | tar xJf`
 which is a combination that is CPU, network and IO bound.
 blobomnom allows network download to proceed efficiently and
 allows curl to exit early once the download is complete, while
 tar can take its time in peace.
